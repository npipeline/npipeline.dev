# Advanced Node Types

Beyond the basic source, transform, and sink nodes, NPipeline offers a suite of advanced node types designed to handle more complex data processing patterns. These nodes enable sophisticated operations like aggregating data, joining streams based on time windows, and duplicating data paths for branching logic or monitoring.

This section delves into the specialized functionalities of these advanced nodes, providing detailed explanations and practical examples to help you leverage their full potential in building robust and efficient data pipelines.

## Implementation Patterns

Each advanced node type is designed to solve specific data processing challenges. The following guides provide implementation details, configuration options, and best practices:
