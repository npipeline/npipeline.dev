Welcome to NPipeline! This section will get you up and running with your first data pipeline in minutes.

## What is NPipeline?

NPipeline is a powerful and flexible .NET library designed for building high-performance, graph-based streaming data pipelines. It empowers developers to construct complex data processing workflows with ease, focusing on efficiency, testability, and maintainability.

At its core, NPipeline allows you to define a series of interconnected operations (nodes) that process data as it flows through the system. This graph-based approach provides clear visibility into your data's journey, making it simple to design, debug, and optimize your pipelines.

### Key Features

* **Graph-Based Architecture:** Visually intuitive and easy to understand data flow.
* **High Performance:** Optimized for low memory allocations and efficient data processing.
* **Extensible:** Easily integrate custom logic and connect to various data sources and destinations.
* **Testable:** Designed with testability in mind, enabling robust and reliable pipelines.
* **Modern .NET:** Leverages the latest C# features and asynchronous programming patterns.

### How it Works

NPipeline pipelines are constructed using a builder pattern, where you define nodes that act as sources, transforms, or sinks.

* **Sources:** Initiate the data flow by producing items.
* **Transforms:** Process and transform data items as they pass through the pipeline.
* **Sinks:** Consume data items, typically writing them to a destination or performing a final action.

These nodes are connected to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), ensuring a clear and predictable data path.

### Benefits for Developers

* **Accelerated Development:** Rapidly build and deploy data pipelines with a clear, concise API.
* **Improved Maintainability:** Graph-based structure and modular components make pipelines easier to understand and modify.
* **Enhanced Reliability:** Robust error handling and testing mechanisms ensure data integrity.
* **Optimal Performance:** Achieve high throughput and low latency for demanding data workloads.
