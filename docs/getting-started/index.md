Welcome to NPipeline! Ready to build your first data pipeline? Follow these three steps to get up and running in minutes.

## See It in Action (60 seconds)

Before building your own pipeline, see what NPipeline can do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NPipeline/NPipeline.git
cd NPipeline/samples/Sample_BasicPipeline
dotnet run
```

You'll see a working pipeline that processes data in real-time—streaming, transforming, and outputting results. This shows the power of NPipeline before you build your own.
