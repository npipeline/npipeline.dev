# Sample Applications

This guide provides practical examples of NPipeline implementations, organized by skill level and complexity. Each sample demonstrates specific concepts and patterns you can apply to your own pipelines.

> **Location:** All samples are located in the `/samples/` directory of the repository. Each sample includes complete source code, configuration files, and a README with detailed explanations.

## Quick Navigation

Choose your learning path based on your experience level:

| Level | Samples | Focus | Time |
|-------|---------|-------|------|
| **Beginner** | [1-5](./basic.md) | Fundamentals, basic patterns | 1-2 hours |
| **Intermediate** | [6-10](./intermediate.md) | Real-world patterns, enrichment, analytics | 2-3 hours |
| **Advanced** | [11-23](./advanced.md) | Complex patterns, production scenarios | 3+ hours |

Alternatively, explore samples [by topic](./by-topic.md).
